Penetration testing hands on. Full vulnerability exploitation and assessment
Windows Server Vulnerability Assessment and Exploitation Project

Welcome to the Windows Server Vulnerability Assessment and Exploitation Project! In this project, you will perform a step-by-step assessment and exploitation of a virtual machine running an older version of Windows Server (specifically, Windows Server 2016). The project will be divided into two main parts: vulnerability assessment and exploitation.

Part 1: Vulnerability Assessment

In this part, you will use Nessus as the primary tool to perform a vulnerability scan on the Windows Server virtual machine. The goal is to identify and document various vulnerabilities present in the system. The assessment will be conducted solely using the IP address of the virtual machine, and no credentials will be used. Nessus will scan the system and provide you with a report on its findings.

Part 2: Exploitation

Once you have identified potential vulnerabilities in the Windows Server system, you will move on to the exploitation phase. This phase involves using Metasploit, a powerful penetration testing tool, to explore and exploit the identified vulnerabilities. Your Kali Linux virtual machine will serve as the attacking platform.

During this phase, you will:

Identify Vulnerabilities: Use Metasploit to investigate the vulnerabilities found in the assessment phase. This may involve searching for specific exploits or vulnerabilities within Metasploit's extensive database.
Exploit the System: Attempt to exploit the identified vulnerabilities to gain access to the Windows Server system. This could involve executing remote code, gaining unauthorized access, or taking control of the system's shell.
Document the Exploitation: Carefully document each step of the exploitation process. Include details such as the vulnerability exploited, the commands used, and the results obtained.
Guidelines and Ethical Considerations

It's important to note that this project should be conducted for educational and ethical purposes only. Unauthorized scanning and exploitation of systems without proper authorization is illegal and unethical. Ensure that you have permission to perform these activities on the target virtual machine.

Important Ethical Considerations:

Always obtain explicit permission to assess and exploit the virtual machine.
Do not attempt to exploit systems that you do not own or have legal permission to access.
Use the knowledge gained for educational and security improvement purposes.
Respect privacy and confidentiality at all times.
Disclaimer

The creators and contributors of this project assume no responsibility for any misuse or illegal activities related to the exploitation of computer systems. It is your responsibility to ensure that all actions are conducted in compliance with applicable laws and ethical guidelines.

Please proceed with caution, adhere to ethical standards, and prioritize responsible and legal cybersecurity practices throughout the project.
